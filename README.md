# Social Coding Quiz App
An application that uses Python and SQLite that allows the user to create and take simple quizzes. 

## Functionality
When the quiz.py file is run, the terminal generates a command-line interface and prompts you to either take a quiz or make a quiz. 
### Take a Quiz 
If 'Take a Quiz' is chosen, the user can choose from a list of quizzes shown on the terminal. After that choice is made, the quiz questions are shown one by one, each time prompting the user for their answer. Note that the quiz questions may only be fill-in-the-blank or multiple choice. As the quiz progresses, the app records the user's answers in a list. Once the user finishes the quiz, their score is displayed and they are prompted to either take another quiz, make a quiz, or exit. For now, quiz questions will be stored in a text file with the correct answers in column 1 and the quiz questions in column 2. The title of the quiz is stored in the first row of the file. A database will be used later to store multiple quizzes.
### Make a Quiz
This feature is set to be implemented after the 'Take a Quiz' feature is finished.
